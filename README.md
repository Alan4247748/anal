# Website

I used [Docusaurus 2], a static website generator, to build my portfoilo Website. 

### Installation

```
I used VSU as my IDE to do a website tranformation, write markdown files, add react components, etc.  
```

### Local Development

```
I used a NPM run build to generate static files & used Local server 3000 to test during dev sprints. 
```

### Build

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

I'm using GitHub as my cloud and Git as my local memory card and to practice some continuous integration techniques. 

For deployment, I will be testing both Netlify (I know) and Vercel (I don't) to serve and deploy the final website.
