# Website

I used [Docusaurus 2], a modern static website generator, to build my portfoilo Website. 

### Installation

```
I used VSU as my IDE to do a website tranformation, write markdown files, etc.  
```

### Local Development

```
I used a NPM run build to generate static files & used Local server 3000 to test during dev sprints. 
```

### Build

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

I'm using GitHub as my cloud/local memory card and to learn a continuous integration best practices. I then autheticate from to netlify to serve and deploy the final website.
